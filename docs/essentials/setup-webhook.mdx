## Prerequisites
Before setting up the webhook, make sure you have:
- Admin or write access to the repository.
- A server endpoint or service URL to handle incoming webhook payloads.
- (Optional) A secret to secure the webhook.

## Steps to Set Up a Webhook

### 1. Go to Your GitHub Repository
Navigate to your GitHub repository where you want to set up the webhook.

### 2. Access the Webhooks Settings
1. On the repository page, click on the **Settings** tab.
2. In the left sidebar, click on **Webhooks**.

### 3. Add a New Webhook
1. Click the **Add webhook** button.
2. In the **Payload URL** field, enter the URL where you want to receive the webhook events (e.g., your API endpoint).
3. Set the **Content type** to `application/json`.

### 4. Choose Events to Trigger the Webhook
Under **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?**:
- Pushes
- Pull Requests

We currently only support `Push` and `Pull Request` events

### 5. Add a Secret (Optional)
To add a secret for securing the webhook, follow these steps:
- Scroll down to the **Secret** field.
- Enter a secret key (a random string of your choice). This secret will be used to generate a hash signature to verify that the requests are coming from GitHub.

Once you've set the secret, GitHub will send a `X-Hub-Signature` header with each payload, which we will use to validate the request by comparing it with your secret.

> **Note**: Be sure to store your secret securely, as it is needed to verify the authenticity of the payloads.

### 6. Enable/Disable SSL Verification
GitHub provides an option to enable or disable SSL verification to ensure the webhook payload is sent over a secure connection.

- **Enable SSL verification (recommended)**: This ensures the webhook is only sent to secure servers with valid SSL certificates. This is the default setting.
- **Disable SSL verification**: If you are using an internal or self-signed certificate for your server, you may want to disable SSL verification. To do this, simply uncheck the **SSL verification** checkbox.

> **Important**: Disabling SSL verification can expose your webhook to man-in-the-middle attacks and should only be done if absolutely necessary for specific use cases.

### 7. Save the Webhook
Once you've configured your webhook settings, click the **Add webhook** button to save it.

You should now see your webhook listed in the Webhooks section of the repository settings.

## Verifying the Webhook
After adding the webhook, GitHub will attempt to send a test payload to the specified URL. You can verify that the webhook is set up correctly by checking your server logs or endpoint to confirm the payload was received.

> If you set a secret, GitHub will also include a `X-Hub-Signature` header, which you can use to verify the integrity of the payload.

## Conclusion
Youâ€™ve successfully set up a GitHub webhook for your repository. By specifying the desired events, adding a secret for security, and enabling/disabling SSL verification, you can customize how your server handles GitHub events.
