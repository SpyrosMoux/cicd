# Welcome to FlowForge

FlowForge is a self-hostable CI/CD platform that runs pipelines using Docker containers. It is designed to be lightweight, easy to deploy, and integrates seamlessly with your repositories.

## Key Features

- üöÄ **Self-hostable**: Run it on your own infrastructure.
- üê≥ **Docker-based**: Pipelines execute inside Docker containers.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Kubernetes Support**: Deploy in Kubernetes with future autoscaling capabilities.
- üîó **Webhook-driven**: Automate builds with repository webhooks.

## Getting Started

### Installation

FlowForge can be installed using Docker Compose:

Example docker-compose.yaml:

<SnippetDockerCompose />

Run it with the following command:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

    Check out the detailed instructions [here](/setup)

### Configuring Webhooks

To trigger builds automatically, configure webhooks in your repository to send events to your FlowForge API endpoint.

## Necessary Parameters

To configure FlowForge properly, ensure you provide the following parameters:
- **DB_USER**: Username of the FlowForge DB.
- **DB_PASS**: Password for the FlowForge DB user.
- **GH_WEBHOOK_SECRET**: Secret key for validating incoming GitHub webhooks.
- **RABBITMQ_USER**: Username for RabbitMQ user.
- **RABBITMQ_PASSWORD**: Password for RabbitMQ user.
- **HOST_NAME**: The host name used to expose the API.

## How It Works

1. A developer pushes code to a repository.
2. A webhook sends a notification to FlowForge.
3. FlowForge determines the appropriate pipeline and enqueues it in RabbitMQ.
4. A runner picks up the job and executes it inside a Docker container.
